# simpleOS

This is my code for writing a simple OS.
You can see the book written by Chinese([操作系统真象还原](https://book.douban.com/subject/26745156/)).

The original book's build system is `make`, which is not easy to use.
So I use `cmake` as build system. Maybe, you can use the code to make
your life easy.
